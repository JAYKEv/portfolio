At Delta Tech-Up Ltd, I spearheaded a real-time web collaboration feature that boosted client satisfaction by 30% and led initiatives that improved API performance by 25%.

Key Achievements:
• Improved system performance by 35% through optimized backend services and database queries
• Reduced API latency by 45% by refactoring GraphQL and REST APIs and optimizing MongoDB queries
• Enhanced reliability and security by implementing structured logging, role-based access control, and automated testing
• Boosted client satisfaction by 30% through real-time web collaboration features
• Led initiatives that improved API performance by 25%

Core Competencies:
• Languages: Java, JavaScript (React, Node.js), Python, TypeScript, SQL, MongoDB
• Development: RESTful API development, secure authentication, and performance optimization
• Methodologies: Agile methodologies, mentoring, and CI/CD pipeline enhancements

I am actively seeking a full-time job opportunity to apply my technical skills, collaborate with forward-thinking teams, and contribute to innovative projects that have real impact.
